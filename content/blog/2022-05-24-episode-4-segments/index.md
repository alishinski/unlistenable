In this episode I explore possible ideas for segments on the show. Many podcasts are built with segments, because they cut off many of the bad things that happen when you just free form ramble. They give you something to structure the show and they help you structure your thoughts, I think. I tried out one segment idea where I entertain one of Chuck Klosterman's [hypertheticals](https://www.chuckklostermanauthor.com/books/hypertheticals-nt) about whether I would sit on an airplane for 11 hours a day for a 10 percent pay bump. I would probably not, but now I have a plan for how I would if the situation compelled me to.
