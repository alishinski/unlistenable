In this episode I talk about, or try to, talk about the motivational positive pressure of an impending deadline. The way that the approaching deadline just sharpens all aspects of my focus, problem solving, and planning. I really love it. I love the experience of getting into the flow of a project where I can continuously triage what needs to be done and then do it. I wonder what it would be like to feel that confidence and power all the time, outside of the context of an impending deadline.
