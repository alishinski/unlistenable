In this episode I explain what the idea behind the show is, why I came up with the idea of a podcast that you can't listen to, and why I really love this idea. Much of this reasoning is described on the about page. As the show went on, I really started to get into it as a fun outlet and on the fly I came up with the tagline "thanks for not listening" which is not super creative, and the turn of phrase "to get my head out my mouth" to describe what the framework of the show helped me to do, which I think is somewhat better.
