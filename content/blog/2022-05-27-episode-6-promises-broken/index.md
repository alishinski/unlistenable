In this episode I talk about my experiences with changing the way I think and process thoughts because of the podcast. I cut off this train of thought early with the promise to return later in the night, but I did not manage to do it. But it's funny the way that just having the podcast exist changes the ways that I am able to process information. I wonder if that'll continue.
